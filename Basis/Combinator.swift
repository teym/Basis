/// Chains of regular function applications are often made unnecessarily verbose and tedius by
/// large amounts of parenthesis.  Because this operator has a low precedence and is right-
/// associative, it can often be used to elide parenthesis such that the following holds:
///
///     f <<| g <<| h x  =  f (g (h (x)))
///
/// Haskellers will know this as the ($) combinator.

/// Pipe Forward | Applies the argument on its left to a function on its right.

/// Sometimes, a computation looks more natural when data is computer first on the right side of
/// an expression and applied to a function on the left.  For example, this:
///
///     and(zip(nubBy(==)(x))(y).map(==))
///		
/// can also be written as:
///
///     let result = nubBy(==)(x) |>> zip(y)
///                               |>> map(==)
