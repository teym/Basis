/// A Monad is an (Endo)Functor (but really, that doesn't matter because all Functors in Swift are
/// *technically* endofunctors) that respects a common-sense set of laws called the Monoid Laws:
///
/// - Closure    Composing two monads produces another monad.  Actually, the same monad, but with a
///              different value inside.  Basically, you cannot ever just compose a monad and
///              randomly come up with something that isn't a monad.
///
/// - Associativity    Composing a monad twice is the same whether you bunch your parenthesis up on
///                    the right side, or the left side. (1 + 1) + 1 = 1 + (1 + 1)
///
/// - Identity    There is some element in the set of possible parametrizations that, when composed
///               with other elements, doesn't alter their value.  Like 0 in addition of the
///               integers: 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1
///
/// A Monad lifts these laws into an algebraic structure and adds an all-important operator for
/// "sequencing" monads together.
///
/// Monads represent a computation in a "context".  If we make that context the "real world" we get
/// the IO Monad.  When that context is the surrounding spine in a structure, we get the List Monad.
///
/// When a chain of monads is built up (M<M<M<...A...>>>), computation is performed by removing an
/// outer M<...>.
