/// Applicative sits in the middle distance between a Functor and a Monad.  An Applicative Functor
/// is a Functor equipped with a function (called point or lift) that takes a value to an instance
/// of a functor containing that value. Applicative Functors provide the ability to operate on not
/// just values, but values in a functorial context such as Eithers, Lists, and Optionals without
/// needing to unwrap or map over their contents.
